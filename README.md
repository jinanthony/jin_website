all the code for Jin website!

This is a project I started 1/12/2024.

I had been designing shirts for a few campus organizations:
(UCSB TASA 2022-2023 T-shirt, UCSB CLimbing Team Hoodies and 
T-shirts 2022-2023, UCSB CAB T-shirts 2022-2023, SBHacks Hacker 
and Organizer T-shirts for SB Hacks X 2023-2024), so I was 
motivated to explore creating personal merchandise using some 
of my favorite personal designs!

In order to do this, it would be necessary to create a webstore
and website to display and sell my designs. 

I decided to create the website using a combination of HTML, CSS, 
and JS. This was primarily to familiarize myself with the ins and 
outs of web development and to get the website up ASAP.

Hope y'all enjoy!
